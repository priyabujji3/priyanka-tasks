==connect from bastion to jenkins, switch to root user
==check whether jenkins running
==yum install git
==check AWS 
==insatll maven with zip package in opt folder(downlod the apache maven)https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.5/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.5-bin.zip
==unzip(unzip apache-maven-3.8.5-bin.zip)
==remove zip file( rm -f apache-maven-3.8.5-bin.zip)
==Rename(mv apache-maven-3.8.5 maven36)
==goto maven 36(cd maven36)
==goto bin in maven36(cd bin)
==create roles in AWS in IAM service

=====amazon s3 full access(policy)
=====role name-Ci_server
==in jenkins switch to bash shell(su - jenkins -s /bin/bash)

AFTER ALL BUILDING OF WAR FILE 
========== cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/build-war-maven/target
==create s3 bucket
==create IAM role and attach to ec2 machine
==aws s3 ls
==touch s3uploaddemo

TO UPLOAD WAR FILE FROM EC2 TO S3
==aws s3 cp s3uploaddemo s3://bucket-war/
==aws s3 cp s3://bucket-war/s3uploaddemo .
==check for file in s3 bucket
FOR MANUAL:::::
warpath=/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/build-war-maven/target/
warfile=sparkjava-hello-world-1.0.war
bucketname=bucket-war
TO COPY WAR FILE TO S3
aws s3 cp $warpath/$warfile s3://$bucketname/
TO DO IN JENKINS AUTOMATICALLY
==remove manually uploaded war file in s3
give above 4 commands in the build and save 
check for the war file in s3

==To rename war file
connect to bastion and jenkins 
INn jenkins user go the /target path
==in jenkins page, before all the old commands attach # and add all the below new commands

/opt/maven36/bin/mvn clean package 
sleep 5
warpath=/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/build-war-maven/target/
warfile=sparkjava-hello-world-1.0.war
newwarfile=sparkhello-$BUILD_NUMBER.war
bucketname=bucket-war
mv $warpath/$warfile $warpath/$newwarfile
aws s3 cp $warpath/$newwarfile s3://$bucketname/

==check in s3 whether the new file added or not(sparkhello-14.war)
aws s3 cp s3 ://bucket-war/sparkhello-15.war .
echo "i am deploying the package to the tomcat"
scp sparkhello-15.war root@172.31.23.18:/opt/tomcat9/webapps/sparkhello.war
