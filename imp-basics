==[[ANSIBLE]]If we want to run one service(or)application like tomcat in many servers at a time in ansible, we have to give all the remote servers private ips in inventory file(or)host file in cd /etc/ansible, then run the play book and the service will run in all servers.
==[TOMCAT]tomcat home directory(/opt/tomcat)
==TO change port number(goto home directory of particular service ex::tomcat and then goto conf and change the port number)
==If permission error comes(chmod 777 file name)
==(~==home directory)
==(/==root directory)
==To check logs(cd bin,ls -ltr, cd logs,ls -ltra,if nothing comes==no issues or errors)
==Trouble shoot=== when checking the tomcat page or jrnkins page
  **We have to check whether URL correct or not
  **In security groups whether port allowed or not
  **Whether port is listening or not (netstat command)
  **Whether the app is running or not(curl - I command)
  **systemctl status tomcat(or)jenkins

                      And then reboot the server or EC2 machine and then we will get hostname)(in ec2 da[shboard in act[ions reboot[)(systemctl reboot service)[([){{[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[
